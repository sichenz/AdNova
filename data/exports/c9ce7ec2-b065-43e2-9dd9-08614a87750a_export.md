Hello, Purple & White Family! NYU folks have one thing in common; we all crave to wear our pride on our sleeves, and what a better way to do that than with our NYU purple! Oh, don't get startled. We have a sense of humor here at NYU, and we're all about keeping things light and fun!

Firstly, let's address the star of the collection; our fabulous floral print dresses. These aren't your standard, run-of-the-mill kinda dresses. These are dresses that scream 'NYU Pride' without you having to utter a single word. Imagine traipsing through Washington Square Park, with the iconic purple flowers mesmerizing passersby as you glide by. 'Wait, is that an NYU floral dress?' they'll wonder. And you can just smile, wave and reply, 'Yes, yes it is.'

But what's a dress without a matching accessory? Here's where our NYU handbag comes into play. The stylish design reflects the soul of our school; bold, confident, and unapologetically NYU. Its practicality and style mean you can take it everywhere, from lectures to internships, from coffee dates to city adventures. Yes, we've thought of it all!

So why is this collection perfect for you, our NYU students, alumni, and families? Because we've got merchandise that resonates with every NYU spirit out there. Whether you're sitting for an exam, reminiscing about your college days, or bursting with pride for your NYU-studying daughter or son, our spring collection will give you that extra sprinkle of NYU spirit!
